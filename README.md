# DOI Linkifier for Publication Pages

A lightweight Tampermonkey userscript that automatically converts plain DOI text (e.g.
`DOI: 10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110868`) into real clickable links
(`https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110868`) on publication listing or detail pages.

This script is designed for use on **publication pages under `https://www.scopus.com/pages/publications/*`**,
but it does **not** use any Scopus trademarks or internal APIs ‚Äî it only modifies visible DOI text.
